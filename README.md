# Frontend Performance Checklist

## INTRO

This project offers essential frontend performance optimization checkpoints to rapidly improve performance metrics.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- **Smaller Size**: Minimize resource size through compression, code cleanup, and efficient formats.
- **Faster Rendering**: Speed up page display by optimizing the critical rendering path and reducing blocking.
- **Greater Reuse**: Leverage caching, CDNs, and reusable components to avoid redundant requests and rendering.
